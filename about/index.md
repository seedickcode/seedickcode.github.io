From hand optimized assembly programming for embedded micro controllers, to operations architecture, to graphic arts.  I have worked professionally in many roles of the IT industry.  I feel I am a jack in all trades, and a master in whatever I have been working on for the past month.  Many things overlap, and knowledge and technology from one branch can be brought into others to bring unique solutions to some of the cooler problems.

## What I can bring to the table:

* Over 30 years experience being immersed in whatever technology I can get my hands on.  This is my career, and my passion.  Having seen many problems and taken many paths develops wisdom that can help guide my planning and development of new projects that 'feels right', and avoiding pitfalls that will get us later down the road.
* Mediator skills to bring diverse teams and viewpoints together into a working solution for all
* Experience teaching technology to all ages and backgrounds has givin me the skills to expain technical problems and solutions to those not in the field.
* Pride in finding technically elegant and simple solutions.
* Ability to sometimes make people laugh so hard they can't breathe
