Sure would be nice to just be able to say stuff into my headset?
As I work though stuff being able to just speak out notes for the blog posts would be hand.
Google does an OK job on my phone, so after some checking around, dictation.io chrome plugin followed by some cut and paste will be the start.

One problem is as soon as you stop talking for a while it shuts down you have to hit the start dictation button again.  Bit of a bother.  API is open, maybe I will craft something to resolve this problem.  Ah, if there was only unlimited time.. /sigh
