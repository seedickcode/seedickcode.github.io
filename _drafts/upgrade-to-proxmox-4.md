For this new monitoring and metrics setup, I am going to be working against my personal network in tandem with a few clients I am rolling out to as well.
Since I am always looking for a reason to branch off into some new tech, I will be upgrading by hypervisor from Proxmox 3 to Proxmox 4 series with LXC containers instead of OpenVZ.
Proxmox is the best dang collection of parts that make up a sweet hypervisor system out there IMHO.  Use it, love it.

I have quite a lot of infrastructure setup against this, so time to dig into the upgrade docs and make sure I have recent backups.
